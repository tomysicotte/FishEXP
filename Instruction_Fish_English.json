  "Intro" : "Welcome to our lab! There are 3 parts in this experiment. Press a key to see the instructions for the first part",

  "SJ_countdown": "The similarity judgement task will start in:",
  "Cat_countdown": "This categorization block starts in:",
  "Key_to_continue":"Press a key to continue",
  "VF_rdy": "Are you ready to continue?",
  "Practice_end" : "The practice is over! You are now ready to start the task.",
  "SJ_ins1" : "In this first task, you will have to judge the similarity of different stimuli. Each stimulus will appear one after the other. After seeing them, you will have to make a subjective judgement about how similar they are.",
  "SJ_ins2" : "To make this judgment, you will have to move the cursor using the mouse. If you think they are very similar, move it to the right; if you think they are very different, move it to the left.",
  "SJ_ins3" : "Please try to use the whole range as you make your similarity judgement and not only the extremities.",
  "SJ_ins4" : "When you are ready, press a key to begin the practice.",
  "SJ_ins5" : "You now have to do a new similarity judgement task. Remember, if you judge the 2 stimuli very similarly you have to move the cursor to the right, and move it to the left if you think they are very different.",
  "SJ_ins6" : "Make sure that the experimenter gave you permission to continue! If so, press a key to start the task.",
  "Similar":"Very Similar",
  "Different":" Very Different",
  "Cat_answer_option" : "K or L",
  "Cat_ins1": "The second task is a category learning task. You will be presented stimuli one by one. Each stimulus belongs to one of the 2 categories 'Kailfish' or 'Limfish'. Feedback will be provided to help you learn the categories.",
  "Cat_ins2": "Every time a stimulus is presented to you, you have to press either 'K' or 'L' on the keyboard. You will then have feedback according to your answer ('Correct' or 'Incorrect').",
  "Cat_ins3": "Every fish is presented for approximately 1 second, it is important that you answer quickly. You have a time limit of 1.5 seconds to answer. This task is composed of 4 blocks of 100 trials. You can take a break between each block.",
  "Cat_ins4": "Make sure that the experimenter gave you permission to continue! If so, press a key to start a practice block.",
  "Cat_between_bloc": "The block is over.",
  "Cat_end": "The categorization task is over. Please wait for the experimenter to give you permission to continue.",
  "Feedback_good": "Correct",
  "Feedback_bad": "Incorrect",
  "Wrong_key": "You pressed a wrong key, please press 'K' or 'L' next time.",
  "Too_long": "You took too long to answer, please answer faster.",
  "Exp_end" : "The experiment is over. Please answer the next few questions. Thank you for you participation!",
  "Q1":"Do you believe your learned to categorize?",
  "A1":["Yes","No"],
  "Q2":"Did you use one or many specific features to categorize?",
  "A2":["Yes, one","Yes, many", "No"],
  "Q3":"If yes, did you focus on the mouth?",
  "A3":["Yes","No", "Sometime"],
  "Q4":"If yes, did you focus the lateral fin?",
